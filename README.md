# wifaq_crawler

Ok, not actually a "crawler" but it's too late to change the name now. Using the URL parameters,
e.g.: http://www.wifaqulmadaris.org/_reports/gazett-madaris.php?gender=M&Examtype=A&ExamYear=1437&course=+0802&Regid=00001&Submit=
and the structure of the page, we cycle through as many ilhaq numbers as you want to find the names of all schools associated with their
ilhaq numbers.
